## Tech

Blossom uses a number of open source technolgies to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - It simplifies the entire method of writing components in high-volume applications.
- [Webpack] - configure control over how to treat different assets it encounters.
- [React Router] 
- [React Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [Redux] - store and share data with multiple components
- [Figma] - Was used to create a proper Sitemap, wireframe, Basic UI

And of course Blossom itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
