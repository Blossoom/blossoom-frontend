This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Blossom uses a number of open source technolgies to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Webpack] - awesome web-based text editor
- [React Router] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [React Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [Redux] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Figma] - Was used to create a proper Sitemap, wireframe, Basic UI

And of course Blossom itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
